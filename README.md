# MUSIC IBD Study Website

A comprehensive NextJS website for the MUSIC and Mini-MUSIC (Mitochondrial DAMPs as mechanistic biomarkers of gut mucosal inflammation in adults and children) IBD research study.

**Live site:** [https://www.musicstudy.uk](https://www.musicstudy.uk)

## üìñ About the Project

This website serves as the online hub for the MUSIC and Mini-MUSIC IBD studies, providing:

- Study information for adult and pediatric participants with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
- Latest research results and publications
- Patient-led research initiatives
- Resources for patients and researchers
- Information about participating centers across Scotland

The MUSIC study is a multi-centre, prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study of 250 IBD patients, which has been running since 2020 in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee to identify newly diagnosed patients with IBD. Participants enter the study in a state of active UC or CD and receive follow-up every 3 months for a year with clinical assessment and blood sampling. Every participant has a baseline colonoscopy and a follow-up colonoscopy at approximately 6 and 12 months to assess for mucosal healing. The Mini-MUSIC study is similar but focusing on children with IBD.
